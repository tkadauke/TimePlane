# TimePlane

This is a small RubyMotion app that eases converting times between time zones. It works by visualizing time lines of configurable timezones on top of each other.

This is just a very small side project of mine. I apologize for not having added tests as I usually do, but I was very tired when I wrote this ;-)

It is in the app store! [Look!](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/timeplane/id717142642?mt=8)

## Features

This app answers questions like the following, just by looking at the screen:

- What time is it in New York city right now?
- If it is 9am here, what will be the time in Hong Kong?
- What local time will be my Skype call with San Francisco at 2pm their time?
- Is it already tomorrow in Sydney?
- How long until midnight in Moscow?
- What time will the sun rise and set today?
